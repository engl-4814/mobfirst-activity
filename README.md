# RECREATE THIS MOBILE-FIRST LAYOUT WITH GRID

Copy a new folder for your group.

Next, review the 3 images in the provided `viewport-images` folder. These images indicate how the layout changes across the provided breakpoint values.

Finally, build on the existing code to recreate this grid across two breakpoints by using `min-width` queries:

1. 768px for tablet/medium 
2. 1280px for large/laptop

## HTML

It's all provided. Be sure to review it and in the browser's inspection tool to understand the structure.

## CSS

Here's where your group will develop your **mobile-first** design.

The code includes some provided defaults for the mobile-first. Your job is to define those scoped breakpoints with media queries, so you can recreate the design with CSS grid (and flex) within those particular viewport width scopes.
